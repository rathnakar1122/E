1. Python Interview Questions[LeetCode]
# a list of dictionaries
# Input:
cars = [
    {
        "make": "Toyota",
        "model": "Camry",
        "year": 2020,
        "price": 24000
    },
    {
        "make": "Honda",
        "model": "Civic",
        "year": 2021,
        "price": 22000
    },
    {
        "make": "Tesla",
        "model": "Model 3",
        "year": 2022,
        "price": 40000
    }
]

#Output:
list_of_car_makers = [ "Toyota","Honda","Tesla"]
:Hints:
Inner object --> Dict
   deep_inner --> String
Outer object --> List
< use both list, dict and str methods along with slicing >
